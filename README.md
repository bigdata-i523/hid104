   title: What Separates Big Data from Lots of Data?
   abstract: >
       We breifly analyze the history of data to show how having
       Lots of Data hardly differs from data storage and analysis 
       in the early days of SQL, or even before computers. We then
       explain how Big Data represents a paradigmatic shift from
       conventional data analysis. We then begin to look at the
       potential limits of Big Data to assert that this paradigmatic
       shift does not mean the end of science. We conclude that 
       misunderstanding Big Data prevents organizations from
       capitalizing on its potential and can lead them to spurious
       answers.
