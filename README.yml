        We breifly analyze the history of data to show how having Lots of Data
        hardly differs from data storage and analysis  in the early days of SQL, or
        even before computers. We then explain how Big Data represents a paradigmatic
        shift from conventional data analysis. We then begin to look at the potential
        limits of Big Data to assert that this paradigmatic shift does not mean the
        end of science. We conclude that  misunderstanding Big Data prevents organizations
        from capitalizing on its potential and can lead them to spurious answers.
