        We breifly analyze the history of data to show how having Lots
        of Data hardly differs from data storage and analysis in the
        early days of SQL, or even before computers. We then explain
        how Big Data represents a paradigmatic shift from conventional
        data analysis. We then begin to look at the potential limits
        of Big Data to assert that this paradigmatic shift does not
        mean the end of science. We conclude that misunderstanding Big
        Data prevents organizations from capitalizing on its potential
        and can lead them to spurious answers.

        Since its origins, Big Data has promised an unimaginable
        potential to revolutionize the world. Scholars have wisely
        noted that it represents a paradigmatic shift from
        conventional norms of data, but the public has quickly latched
        onto provocative but unrealistic narratives that deify big
        data as omniscient, infallible, and devoid of bias. Confiding
        in such narratives diminishes the integrity of credible
        science and poses serious ethical challenges, but these
        challenges are more likely overlooked because the very
        narratives seem to reject the need for ethical discussion. The
        authors argue that such blind optimism will cause irreversible
        damage to society if left unchecked. First we debunk the
        fallacious narratives people tend to tell about big data,
        offering a more realistic discussion of its merits and its
        limitations.  We then explore how analytical or algorithmic
        bias and sampling bias, two problems that statisticians have
        faced since long before the onset of big data, present
        pitfalls for deriving knowledge from data. We examine how the
        ethical implications of these pitfalls can cause serious
        damage in society. We conclude that Big Data analysis must
        obey the principles of transparency, clear and appropriate
        objective definition, and self-correcting feedback mechanisms.
